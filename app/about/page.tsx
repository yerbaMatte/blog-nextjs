            Professionally, I&apos;m a front-end developer who&apos;s passionate
            about web development, performance optimization, and best practices.

          <p className="py-2 text-justify">
            I previously served as an Imagery Intelligence Officer in the Polish
            Army and graduated from the Military University of Technology in
            2020. During my service, I contributed to developing a front-end
            application for my unit as part of a project with NATO, requiring
            security clearances to handle NATO Secret confidential information.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-justify">
            Outside of front-end development, I also work with Python in a
            commercial setting. I&apos;m passionate about Linux and run a
            Proxmox server at home with several virtual machines. This lets me
            dive into server management, networking, and virtualization,
            expanding my skills across different tech areas.
